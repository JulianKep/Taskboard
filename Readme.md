## Execution:

node index.js in root directory

## Insights:

The folder is called public (by convention) because everything inside it is publicly accessible to the client â€” meaning the browser can load files from it directly, it is sent to the client

- [x] delete Tasks

- [ ] set a "latest point in time to complete task" -> google calendar integration

- [ ] pending status (status in general) maybe do today status

- [ ] sort the list by(status, difficulty, id, ..)

- [ ] each task has popupwindow with additional description(maybe settings) to reflect why task is difficult

- [ ] renewable tasks

- [ ] xp score/money score

- [ ] rewards somehow maybe with euros

- [ ] schedule tasks
