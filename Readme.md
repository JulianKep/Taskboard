## Execution:

node index.js in root directory

## Insights:

The folder is called public (by convention) because everything inside it is publicly accessible to the client â€” meaning the browser can load files from it directly, it is sent to the client

## Deployment:

1. SSH into EC2:
   
   ssh -i "julian-pc.pem" ubuntu@ec2-13-60-2-93.eu-north-1.compute.amazonaws.com
